							<h1>PlayStation 2</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS2/PS2.png" alt="The Sony PS2"/>
							<p>The PlayStation 2 was a fairly sized console, measuring in at 79 mm high, by 302 mm wide, by 183 mm deep. The device weighed in at a modest 2.2 kg with a hard drive extension.</p>
							<p>The console had a simple design, with a main body that had a grill like structure on the sides, with a base below that was smaller and aligned to the left side. On the grill was 2 memory card slots above two controller lots on the left, with a disc drive on the right, and power and eject buttons on the very right. The colour scheme was simple, being all matt back apart from a bit of blue on the front of the base around a USB port, and a blue to turquoise gradient for the logo on the top.</p>

							<h1>DualShock 2</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS2/DS2.png" alt="The Sony PS2 Controller: The DualShock 2"/>
							<p>The DualShock 2 had no design changes from the DualShock one, featuring the same layout of select and start keys in the middle, with 2 joysticks just below, 4 face buttons on the right and a D-pad on the left. With a trigger and a bumper on the top above both the D-pad and the face buttons. The only design difference would be the change in colour from grey to black. All the other major changes to the controller design we’re technical.</p>

							<h1>PlayStation 2 Slim</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS2/SlimShady.png" alt="The Sony PS2 Slim"/>
							<p>The PlayStation 2 slim was a major improvement on the size of the PlayStation 2, reducing it down to just 28 mm tall, by 230 mm wide, by 152 mm deep. </p>
							<p>The device features the same style, however much shorter. The most notable changes are the introduction of a glossy trim on the top that separates the left third of the top from the right two thirds, of which is a flap for the disc drive. The power and eject buttons have also changed, being wider, and with the disc flap open button (rather than disc eject) being moved to below the left side of the disc drive flap, and the power button below the right side.</p>

							<h1>PlayStation 3</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS3/PS3.png" alt="The Sony PS3"/>
							<p>The original PS3 was a large monolithic console that measured at 98 mm tall, by 325 mm wide, by 274 mm deep, making it the largest of the consoles of that generation at launch.</p>
							<p>The design of the ps3 included a curved top, which has a cut out at the front right for the disc drive. The original ps4 had several available colour schemes over its lifetime, including piano black (a glossy black colour), ceramic white (a glossy white), and statin silver, all with a silver trim on top at the cut off for the disc drive.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:900px;">
							<h1>DualShock 3</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS3/DualShock 3.png" alt="The Sony PS3 Controller: The DualShock 3"/>
							<p>The DualShock 3 was a very minor revision to the DualShock 2, barely changing anything. All the buttons, joysticks, and triggers were in the same place, bar a missing analog button, which was replaced with a home button. The only other updates were for its move to wireless, there was no longer a wire coming out the back, rather a mini-B charging port, and there was also 4 LED indicator light to display which player the controller was.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:2570px;">
							<h1>PlayStation 3 Slim</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS3/PS3 Slim.png" alt="The Sony PS3 Slim"/>
							<p>The PS3 slim improved on the PS3’s size significantly, dropping to only 65 mm tall, by 290 mm wide and deep, an impressive feat considering the original’s size and that it got to keep the same performance.</p>
							<p>The PS4 slim majorly looked the same, the original design had seemingly just been squished down, making the curve smaller, the cut out for the disc drive was also shallower, no longer cutting as deep. The slim also brought new colour schemes, the default choice, charcoal black, was an all matt black console, without any trim. There were also several bundle editions, including, but not limited to: a titanium blue; bundled with grand turismo, a magical gold; bundled with Ni No Kuni (but only in japan), and a “Splash Blue and Scarlet Red” editions (which were also japan only). All bundles also included similar coloured controllers.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:2380px;">
							<h1>PlayStation 3 Super Slim</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS3/PS3 Super Slim.png" alt="The Sony PS3 Super Slim"/>
							<p>With the PS3 Super Slim, Sony has somehow managed to cram all of the PS3 into an even smaller space. The hardware was been fit into an impressive 60 mm high, by 290 mm wide, by 230 mm deep.</p>
							<p>The console has once again got a shorter with a reduced curve, the top of the curve is now a grill like texture, and split level, with the left side recessed slightly. the disk drive has been moved from the front to the top, underneath the right side, of which lifts up like the PS2 slim. The default colour scheme is mainly glossy black, with the grill pattern on top and sides as matt black (still referred to as charcoal black). This console also had multiple bundle editions, including: Azurite Blue; an exclusive to GameStop which had the same glossy and matt design but blue instead of black, Black and Blue; a Japanese exclusive for Metal Gear Revengence where the matt grill texture on the top is blue and the glossy bit is normal black, and classic white, a God of War: Ascension which had the same glossy and matt design but white.</p>

							<h1>PlayStation 4</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS4/PS4.png" alt="The Sony PS4"/>
							<p>The PlayStation 4 was released at a reasonable size of 53 mm tall, by 305 mm wide, by 275 mm deep. Weighing in at only 2.8kg, the PS4 was definitely the smaller console of this generation. Unlike its competitor, the PS4 did not require a power brick, plugging directly into the wall, meaning its total footprint was even further reduced when compared to its competition.</p>
							<p>The PS4 has an all matt black colour scheme aside from the left third of the front and top faces, which are glossy black, it has a skewed build giving it the impression that it was leaning away from you, and  through the middle of the sides, has a recessed bit, hiding the disc drive and IO.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:800px;">
							<h1>DualShock 4</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS4/DualShock 4.png" alt="The Sony PS4 Controller: DualShock 4"/>
							<p>The DualShock 4 controller has undergone a somewhat minor revision since the previous model, while holding the same profile, though it is a little larger. it has made fairly major changes. The face has gained a touchpad in the middle, moving the home button down between the joysticks and removing the start and select buttons entirely, replacing them with a dedicated share button by the d-pad, and an options button by the face buttons. The joysticks have gained a dip in the middle, allowing a stronger grip on them with your thumbs. The controller has also gained a headphone jack at the bottom, as well as an EXT port, which is a proprietary port for charging (used by docks).</p>
							<p>Moving onto the back, the bumpers and triggers have gained a sleeker round appearance, and the mini-B port has been replaced with a micro USB port that has been moved down by a large light panel, of which games on the PS4 can manipulate.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:1659px;">
							<h1>PlayStation 4 Slim</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS4/PS4 Slim.png" alt="The Sony PS4 Slim"/>
							<p>The PlayStation 4 slim somehow improved on the size of the original, becoming 39 mm tall, by 288 mm wide, by 265 mm deep. Sony even managed to reduce the weight of the console by 0.7 kg, making it 2.1kg. The Slim achieves its smaller height as the top half above the recessed area is shorter. The Slim also has a greater skew, making it appear to lean back even further, and is all matt black, dropping the separator as well.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:550px;">
							<h1>PlayStation 4 Pro</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Playstation/PS4/PS4 Pro.png" alt="The Sony PS4 Pro"/>
							<p>Measuring in at 55mm tall, by 327 mm wide, by 295 mm deep, the PS4 is definitely the largest console Sony has to offer. On top of that, the behemoth weights 3.3kg, .5kg more than the original model.</p>
							<p>Like the PS4 Slim, the Pro is all matt black, however it now has two recessed areas on the sides, with the disc drive in the top one, and the IO in the lower one. This gives it the impression of two of the slim models stacked on top of each other. The pro also has a few customs designs bundled with games, for example, the game Death Stranding boasts a console with a white glossy material, with “two B.T. handprints that form the shapes of the world’s continents” plastered on top. This also comes with a custom controller with see through orange case, revealing the internals of the controller.</p>

							<h1>Xbox</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/Original/Xbox.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox"/>
							<p>The Xbox was Microsoft’s sizable entry into console gaming, the console stood at 100 mm tall, by 320 mm wide, by 260 mm deep. This large device weighed in at 4kg, making it the largest of the generation.</p>
							<p>The Xbox had a very distinctive design: it had an X shape covering the top, with the green Xbox logo in the middle, and a grill pattern on the left and right spaces left by the X and also on the left and right sides. The front had the disc drive in the top left, a power and disc eject buttons inside a dip in the middle (funnily enough the power button is about half the radius of the eject button), and 2 controller ports either side of that dip. The Xbox had a basic colour scheme, being all matt black.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:950px;">
							<h1>Duke Controller</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/Original/Duke Controller.png" alt="The Microsoft Duke Controller"/>
							<p>The Interesting design of the Xbox also warranted an interesting controller. The duke controller was a bulky controller. The controller clearly had subtle inspiration from the Sega Dreamcast’s controller, given the face button, left joystick and d-pad positioning, as well as the memory card slots on the back. The controller featured a huge Xbox logo front and centre, taking up more space than the individual joysticks, or buttons. Below that was the back and start buttons, to the right were 6 colour coded buttons with a joystick below them. Finally, to the left of the logo was the other joystick with a d-pad below. On the top of the controller featured 2 memory card slots, with a small trigger either side. This design was definitely separate from Microsoft’s main competitor, Sony.</p>
							<p>Some sources say that the duke controller was huge due to the manufacturers contracted by Microsoft refusing to copy Sony’s “Stacked circuit board” design. This action harmed the Xbox as the bulky design they had to go with was laughable.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:850px;">
							<h1>S Controller</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/Original/S Controller.png" alt="The Microsoft S Controller"/>
							<p>In a smart move by Microsoft, before releasing the Xbox console to more regions, they redesigned the duke controller to a smaller, more sensible size. This controller, named the S controller (short for small, presumably), rearranged a few buttons while majorly keeping the same layout. This was possible as the logo was shrunk to about the same size as the D-pad. The black and white face buttons were moved below the main ABXY buttons, and the back and start buttons were moved to below the left joystick.</p>

							<h1>Xbox 360</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/360/360.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox 360"/>
							<p>The Xbox 360 was a large console, standing at 80 mm tall, by 310 mm wide, by 268 mm deep. However, unlike other consoles, it was advertised standing on its side. The console weighs in at a whopping 3.5 kg. The Xbox 360 also required a power brick, making its footprint even larger.</p>
							<p>The goliath had a matt white design, with silver left and right faces. The disc drive was a shiny silver, making it stand out from the surrounding white. The console used hard edges for the left and right faces, but curved in the transition between the front, top, bottom and back faces, giving the impression of a single continuous panel. A very significant and identifying feature of the Xbox 360 was the large lump on the left face (of which would be the top face when stood on its side), this housed the expandable storage, and was significantly prominent.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:900px;">
							<h1>Xbox 360 Controller</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/360/White Controller.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller"/>
							<p>The Xbox 360 controller was a simple iteration of the Xbox S controller, majorly keeping the layout but improving the design significantly. The body became much smother, dropping the raised areas of the S controller, adopting a sleeker looking design. The start and select buttons were moved next to the home button, which became smaller, and had the logo across the whole button, no longer sharing it with the brand name. The 360 Controller as also lost the white and black buttons. On the bottom, the controller gained a port for a proprietary headphone jack, which is just a normal one but in a strange smaller form factor. Moving onto the back, the 360 Controller dropped the two memory card slots, but has gained a bumper above both triggers. The back also has a large battery box protruding out, which holds 2 AA batteries.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:1190px;">
							<h1>Xbox 360 Arcade</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/360/360 Arcade.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox 360 Arcade"/>
							<p>The Xbox 360 arcade is very similar to the Xbox 360, however by default it lacks the hard drive bump that the original, though one can be added. This version of the console adopts a brighter white, and the disc drive has changed to being white, otherwise, the console is exactly the same.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:1350px;">
							<h1>Xbox 360 Elite</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/360/360 Elite.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox 360 Elite"/>
							<p>The Xbox 360 elite is majorly unchanged from the original, it is no bigger, and no heavier. However, the colour scheme has been swapped out for all-black, including the previously grey sides. The disc drive has managed to keep the silver colour though. This version of the console also comes with a black controller, as does all future consoles.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:1250px;">
							<h1>Xbox 360 S</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/360/360 S.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox 360 S"/>
							<p>The Xbox 360 S was a finally fresh development that broke the previous style. The new design measures up at 82 mm tall, by 270 mm wide, by 260 mm deep, a fairly major improvement.</p>
							<p>The design of the console has fairly majorly changed from the previous designs, this time the whole console is matt black, including the sides and disc drive, however, unlike the other consoles the power button (sensor? It’s not tactile, but it turns on the console) is silver, rather than a matching colour to the rest of the console. Finally, the major change to the design is that the console dips in on the front and back, giving a dented appearance. The S has also dropped the hard drive hump, as the top can be opened to reveal an internal hard drive bay.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:1100px;">
							<h1>Xbox 360 E</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/360/360 E.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox 360 E"/>
							<p>The final version of the Xbox 360, the Xbox 360 E, once again redesigns the 360 completely, making it look more like the Xbox One. The console is split roughly 2/3 glossy black and 1/3 matt black. There are angled grills on the right and left sides, and on the matt black third of the top. The iconic power button of the 360 is gone, and a new simple tactile power button has been placed just next to the disc drive.</p>

							<h1>Xbox One</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/One/Xbox One/Full View.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox One"/>
							<p>The Xbox One originally released as a large console, it was 79 mm tall, by 333 mm wide, by 274 mm deep, and was 3.5kg. This model required a large external power brick as well to power the beast. The monolith had a black colour scheme, with an alternating split of glossy and matt on the top and front, and right faces. The right side of the top, and the two side faces had angled slits for cool looks and airflow. </p>
							<p>Many game bundles came with custom console designs with unique looks, such as Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare; which was styled “with Sentinel Task Force iconography”, and Sunset Overdrive; which had a “Cirrus White Xbox One Console”.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:800px;">
							<h1>Xbox One Controller</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/One/Xbox One/Controller.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox One Controller"/>
							<p>The Xbox one controller evolved the design of the 360 Controller, while similar, it did boast some great improvements. The large battery compartment on the back of the 360 Controller was removed and the batteries were embedded inside the body, making the controller less bulky. The face was only minorly changed, with the majority of the inputs only getting changes to the quality of feeling, remaining in the same layout, however the large Xbox home button was made smaller moved up between the triggers, giving it a cleaner feel. The triggers and the bumpers were completely changed, made bigger and more pronounced for a more natural feeling. The Xbox one controller also dropped the proprietary charging port and headphone jack, in favour of a standard micro USB and a regular headphone jack.</p>
							<p>The Xbox store contains a design lab for controllers, enabling users to customise the design of every part of their controllers, from the main body to the ABXY face buttons. It even allows you to add a laser engraving onto the front for added personalisation.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:1090px;">
							<h1>Xbox One S</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/One/Xbox One S/Full View.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox One S"/>
							<p>The Xbox One S (slim) made improvements to the original model with a massive reduction in size, dropping to 64 mm tall, by 295 mm wide, by 230 mm deep, bringing it to be 40% smaller. </p>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/One/Xbox One S/Size Comparison.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox One S Size Comparison"/>
							<p>The console also brings a reduction in weight to just 2.9kg. Despite this reduction in size, the slim also managed to remove the requirement for a power brick, removing some extra bulk from the console and allowing it to plug directly into the wall. This new design boasted an all-white matt colour scheme, with round holes across the right side of the front and top faces, and all across the left and right faces. The console has also undergone a design change, having a stepped depth change from the body to the bottom, as opposed to the angle slope the original version used.</p>
							<p>This version of the console also comes with a game bundle designs, this time being a nice purple to darker purple gradient for Fortnite.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:550px;">
							<h1>Xbox One S All Digital</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/One/Xbox One S/Full View All Digital.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox One S All Digital"/>
							<p>The Xbox one S All digital edition is majorly exactly the same as the normal Xbox one S, however it is lacking a disc drive, which does reduce its weight by 0.45kg, otherwise there are no differences, it is the exact same size and colour.</p>
						</div>
						<div name="Content Aligner" style="Height:547.4px;">
							<h1>Xbox One X</h1>
							<img class="centre" src="../Images/Xbox/One/Xbox One X/Full View.png" alt="The Microsoft Xbox One X"/>
							<p>The Xbox One X is the latest beast in Microsoft’s corner, boasting the title of the world’s most powerful console. This epic machine is slightly larger than the Slim model, at 60 mm tall, by 300 mm wide, by 240 mm deep, however this device is clearly packed full of powerful tech, as it weighs in at 3.81 kg, even more than the original console, despite being about half the size. The X has a pure matt black design now, with circular holes covering the left and right faces. The disc drive has also been moved down to just below the lip of the main body on the bottom piece, which is also now stands taller, to compensate, the main body is shorter.</p>
							<p>The X has its fair share of game bundle designs, showing fresh styles from gears of war; which features the “Crimson Omen immersed in ice and snow” on the console, a Battlefield V bundle; with a nice brown to black gradient across the console, and many more.</p>
