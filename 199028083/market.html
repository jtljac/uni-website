						PS2 is the best selling console overall.  It was manufactured for 12 years. When it comes to sales, it can be clearly seen that Playstation 2 outclassed the first Xbox. It managed to become very popular in the Europe and also in the North America.
						Playstation 2 initially costed 299$. It was acceptable price for a new console at the beginning of the 2000s. </p>

						At the beginning Playstation 3 costed 800$ to manufacture. Given that the units were sold for 499$ or 599$, Sony lost between 200 â€“ 300$ depending on the model.

Playstation 4 costs 381$ to make, it was sold at the premiere for 399$. Demand for the PS4 was strong, hence in August 2013, Sony announced the placement of over a million pre-orders for the console.

						First Xbox also costed 299$. However, Microsoft spent 425$ to manufacture one system. In consequence the company relied rather on software sales to make the money. It was successfull in the US, but still it was not enough to compete with Playstation 2

						EMEA region: 14 million

						It is estimated that it costs 500$ to make a single unit. Since Xbox 360 initial price was 399$. Given that, when introduced Microsoft was losing the money on the console par excellence.

<p>It costs around 460$ to manufacture one unit. Since it was sold at the beginning for approximately 
499$, Microsoft actually managed to make profit out of it (which is not always the case). Demand for Xbox One was also strong. One million consoles were sold within its first 24 hours of being available. The console is advertised as 'home media center' and in consequence has to compete with Apple TV and Google TV. </p>

					<h3>Summary</h3><p>
					Compared to the previous generations, current one's manufacturing costs are slightly lower that the retail price. In conclusion, it took two generations of consoles for companies to learn how to balance manufacturing costs and the initial price. It does not imply that PS4 and Xbox One themselves (as devices, excluding software) give massive profits to the companies. That is why exclusive content is very important in marketing of that generation.</p>
