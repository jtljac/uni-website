				<p class="indexContent">Gaming is arguable one of the most important factors driving development of computer hardware. Console gaming have a strong position in computing, they have made powerful technology available to the common person in their household, thus creating a large and profitable community that brings the demand for innovation and improvement.</p>
				<p class="indexContentRight">These improvements are useful for industry purposes as the equipment that power gaming also can be used for many other purposes; including advanced simulation, cryptocurrency, video editing and data analysis. All of these rides off power created from the advancements designed and marketed for the gaming community. </p>

					<p class="indexContent">The design of consoles and their accessories is very important, it defines the image of the console; making it instantly recognisable, it determines the accessibility of the console to the user, and it can even influence some user’s decisions on which device to purchase. This page describes the competing consoles of Sony and Microsoft through the years, looking at how they have developed and their accessibility to the users.</p>

                    Hardware consists of the set of physical elements which constitute a operating system or, in our case of study, gaming consoles. Knowledge of the Hardware is important to understand how today we can play all that 4K games and store and read that large amount of data so fast. This section deals with the masterpieces of Microsoft and Sony which are The XBOXs and PlayStations, furthermore will illustrate the main features of the Hardware, such as CPU, GPU, RAM, HDD (storage).

					<p class="indexContent">On this page I have focused on the technology used by the main competetors in the console gaming industry, Sony and Microsoft, and more specifically their controllers. I believe this is significant in the history of the consoles because it is the key way in which the user interacts with the console. This is significant because the way the player interacts with the console determines their overall experience, and the evolution of these devices has kept players intrigued for years with their new technologies. Most of this evolution was driven by competition, which rapidly forced the controllers to develop far beyond a player's basic gaming needs; from the clunky design of the first Xbox controller to the new wireless Dualshock 4 with built in accelerometers.</p>

					<h1 class="indexHeading">Marketing</h1>
					<p class="indexContent">Since the premiere of Playstation 2, consoles have become an inherent part of many people’s existence. There is certainly a high demand for them - there are hundreds of millions of units sold worldwide. Nowadays they offer much more than gaming and want to be ‘home media center’. Compared to the previous generations, the current one's manufacturing costs are slightly lower than the retail price. Surprisingly, it took two generations of consoles for companies to learn how to balance manufacturing costs and the initial price. It does not imply that PS4 and Xbox One themselves (as devices, excluding software) give massive profits to the companies. That is why companies rely more on promoting software or any kind of exclusive content. These two are very important in the marketing activities of the current generation.</p>
